# Match 3 System - Jason Siegersma

## Overview
This Match-3 system is built using Unity and written in C#. It allows tiles to be swapped, matched, cleared, and refilled dynamically. The system ensures that tiles fall into empty spaces rather than respawning in the same spot. 

A special **white tile** is included, which can match with any color. When matched, it clears all tiles of that color from the grid.

## Features
âœ… No pre-existing matches at the start.  
âœ… Swappable tiles with valid match detection.  
âœ… Tile gravity ensures tiles fall into empty spaces.  
âœ… Grid automatically refills after matches.  
âœ… Special **white tile** that clears all of one color when matched.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Scripts Included

### 1. `GridManager.cs`
**Responsibilities:**
- Initializes the grid with random tiles.
- Ensures no matches are present at the start.
- Handles tile swapping and match detection.
- Applies gravity so tiles fall after matches.
- Refills the grid when tiles are cleared.

**Key Variables:**
```csharp
[SerializeField] private int width = 8;
[SerializeField] private int height = 8;
[SerializeField] private float tileSize = 1.0f;
```
width and height: Define the grid size.

tileSize: Controls the spacing between tiles.

### 2. Tile.cs
**Responsibilities:**

- Represents individual tiles in the game.
- Handles tile selection, visual feedback, and position updates.

## Some other Mechanic Grid Match 3 by Jason Siegersma

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

## Health System Script by Gael Griffith


* âœ… Initializes health based on HealthConfig.
* âœ… Allows an entity to take damage and apply damage multipliers.
* âœ… Allows an entity to heal without exceeding max health.
* âœ… Enables health regeneration if configured.
* âœ… Stops regeneration upon death and triggers the OnDeath event.
* âœ… Supports temporary buffs for max health, damage resistance, and regen rate.
* âœ… Uses events to notify other scripts (e.g., UI updates).
* This script makes health modular, meaning you can apply it to different characters (players, enemies, bosses) with unique stats simply by assigning a different HealthConfig. ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥
